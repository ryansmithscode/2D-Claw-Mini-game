# 2D Claw Mini-game (2021)

Although this is my first game it clearly demonstrates my knowledge on how to appropriately use tags, layers and collision. I successfully lead a team consisting of a concept artist, pixel artist and a musician.

The theme was recycling and the goal was to make a core gameplay loop that would be less than 30 seconds, which we fulfilled. As it was my first ever project it only lasted approximately one month (pre-production to post) and was built in Unity 2020.3.16f1 using The legacy Input Manager. It can be played using the arrow keys for moving the claw and holding spacebar to grab items.
